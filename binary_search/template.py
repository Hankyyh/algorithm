Most Generalized Binary Search
Suppose we have a search space. It could be an array, a range, etc. Usually it's sorted in ascend order. For most tasks, we can transform the requirement into the following generalized form:

Minimize k , s.t. condition(k) is True

The following code is the most generalized binary search template:

def binary_search(array) -> int:
    def condition(value) -> bool:
        pass

    left, right = 0, len(array)
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if condition(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
