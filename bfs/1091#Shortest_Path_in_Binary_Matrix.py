# 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix
# Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return -1.
#
# A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., (0, 0)) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., (n - 1, n - 1)) such that:
#
# All the visited cells of the path are 0.
# All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).
# The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
# Output: 2
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
# Output: 4
# Example 3:
#
# Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
# Output: -1
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# n == grid.length
# n == grid[i].length
# 1 <= n <= 100
# grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
